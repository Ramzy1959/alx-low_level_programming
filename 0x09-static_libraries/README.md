static libraries in C
Static libraries in C are a collection of object files that can be linked with a program during the compilation process. They are a way to organize and reuse code in multiple projects without having to recompile the code each time.

Here are the steps to create and use a static library in C:
Write the source code for the functions you want to include in the library, and compile them into object files with the "-c" flag.

Once you have compiled all the source files into object files, create the static library with the "ar" command.

To use the static library in your program, include its header file in your source code and link with the library during compilation.

And that's it! With these simple steps, you can create and use static libraries in your C projects to make your code more organized and reusable.
